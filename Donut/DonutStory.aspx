	<p>In 2012 SuzyQ Doughnuts opened in a little white shack in Hintonburg. The doughnuts honour the old Finnish traditional recipe of the “Sugar Munkki” with new and unique flavours being created all the time. The combination of classics such as Maple Bacon, Cookies n’ Cream, Dirty Chocolate and Salty Caramel with more experimental and seasonal flavours such as Blue Vanilla Fruit Loop, Mango Lassi, Raspberry Lemonade and Bumbleberry has made SuzyQ a must-visit in Ottawa's burgeoning food scene.</p>
